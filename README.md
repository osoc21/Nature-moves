# Nature-moves

## About

Natuurpunt has a lot of nature reserves they wanted to put on the map. To achieve this we used Mapcomplete, a tool created by Pieter Vander Vennet.

With Mapcomplete we created a map viewing and map editing tool designed for Natuurpunt, which contains all nature reserves, walking trails and other points of interest. Natuurpunt will be able to put this map on their website.

This map viewing tool will be used by visitors of Natuurpunt and the editing tool will be used by the nature reserve caretakers and other volunteers of Natuurpunt.
